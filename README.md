# Blocky-RPG-Concept
An interactive drawing inspired by the role-playing game genre. There will be a small square character that follows the mouse, and an NPC character that will act as a button. When interacted with the NPC will produce a speech bubble with text in it. The background will be nature themed, and there will be trees added to some areas of the drawing. There will also be a small enemy towards the middle of the screen who will move based on a loop.

### List of Concepts to include
1. Background â€“ use the import and display image for it 
2. Make a little character that follows the mouse position 
3. Make a little NPC that acts as a button, so when the character is in a space in front of them and presses a key, it interacts and causes a chat bubble 
4. Chat bubble to incorporate typography 
5. Use a different text style and maybe change the color 
6. Create a little enemy that moves uses a for loop/if statements 
7. Choose a color pallet for the characters and background 
8. Use the polar library to create the characters or aspects of them as the functions make it easy to angle shapes 
9. Create a function that draws little trees, and then may use a for loop to scale them  
10. Use triangle function, curve function, and/or begin and end shape in the drawings 
11. Use a math/trig statement in changing an aspect of a function 
12. Use an array in an aspect of a function 
13. Use push and pop functions when creating the trees or other parts of the drawings
